TODO list (high level)

1. MDRNN Cell - Done (But may need further testing)

2. Image Transformation function - shift the it-row by i pixels - Done

3. Create a network of MDRNN Cells with height equal to the height of the image 
that can be used to scan the image in parallel, one transformed image colum at a time
(what about padding for the cells on the boundary?)

4. Create a method that, using the network of step 3, computes the MDRNN activation for 
   each pixel. Save these activations to a "context vector / image representation vector".

5. Train a classifier using the representation computed in 4. Use it for MNIST prediction

6. Repeat step 4 in 4 different directions, combine the 4 representations. This is now 
   the multi-directional multi-dimensional RNN. See how classification performance improves.

7. Implement the Multi-dimensional LSTM, analogous to the Multi-dimensional RNN implementation.

8. Repeat the previous steps with the Multi-dimensional LSTM cell.

9. Combine the Multi-Dimensional LSTM image representations with convolutional network components 
   and other network components into a more complex neural network.

10. Add ab attention mechanism.
